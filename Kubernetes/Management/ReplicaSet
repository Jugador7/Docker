If an app is deployed on a single pod, the pod will be unable to perform certain actions if requests increas manifold or outages. 

ReplicaSet:

Ensures the right number of pods are always up and running. 

Adds or deletes pods for scaling and redundancies. 
Supersedes replicaControllers

Best managed by a deployment. Is created by the very deployment. 

I t does not own pods, uses pod labels. 

To create a replicaSet from scratch Apply a YAML
1. kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml
2. kubectl get pods
3. kubectl get rs

Create deployment:
1. kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
2. kubectl get pods
3. kubectl get deploy

Scale deployment:
1. kubectl scale deploy hello-kubernetes -- replicas = 3
