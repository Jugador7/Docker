Enables scaling as needed.

Two levels: Cluster/node level and pod level

kubectl autoscale deploy hello-kubernetes --min=2 --max=5 --cpu-percent=50

Autoscaling types:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Adjusts the number of replicas of an application by increasing or decreasing the number of pods. 
- Updates a deployment
- Uses a cluster operatior like CPU or memory
- You can use a YAML file for this HPA

Vertical pOd Autoscaler (VPA): Adjusts requests and resources of the pods
- Adds more resources to an existing machine. 
- CPU and memory 
- Use together with HPA eith external metrics. 

Cluster Autoscaler (CA): Adjusts number of nodes in the cluster when pods fail to schedule or when demand increases or decreases in relation to the capacity of existing nodes. 
- When nodes are overflown with pods.
