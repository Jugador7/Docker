Operator intro:
- Operators automate cluster tasks and act a custom controller to extend the kubernetes api. 
- Run in a pod and interact with api server. 
- Packages, depoloys and manages kubernetes apps. 
- Human operator vsd software operators (captures knowledge of humans)

Why use operators? 
- Repeatable installs and upgrades
- Regular full-system health checks
- Over-the-air updates
- Communication tools
- Integration. 

Service Brokers vs Operators
- Service Brokers: short-running process that cannot perform the consecutive day's operations such as upgrades or scaling 
- Customizations and parametrizations only at the time of installation 
- off cluster services. 

-Operatiors: A long-running process that can perform operations like upgrades, failover or scaling every day. 
- Customizations and parametrization, as operators constantly watch the current state of your cluster. 
- off cluster services. 

CRD (custom resource definition)
- Extends kubernetes API. 
Can be installed in clusters. 
- Accesibklae using jubectl. 

Custom controllers

Controllers reconcile a cluster's actual state with its configured state. 

Custom controllers do the same reconciling for custom resources (CRDs)

Combining CRDs and custom controllers creates a declarative API

This combination is known as the operator pattern. 

Operator framework:
- Coding, testing, delivery and operator updates. 

Operator SDK
- KHelps build

LOM controlls operator install and upgrade

Operator Registry: Stores CRD, CSVs and operator data

OperatorHub. 

Operator Maturity Model: 
Shows capabiliteies operated by helm, ansible and go. 

Operations in practice: 

To deploy a complete application: 
1. Create a custome resource for the app. 
2. Create a custome controller for this CRD
3. Operator logic determines how to reconcile the actual and desired states. 
4. A crd requires the creation of other objects 
5. OperatorHub view: Enables installation with one click. Operators availabkle form red hat, certified, custom and community. 
6. You can install many kubernetes tools wiht this.
