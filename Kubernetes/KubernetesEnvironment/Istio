Istio
- A dedicated infrastructure layer that adds capabilities (to applications without adding to code) such as traffic management, security and
observability. 
- Helps to make service-to-service communication fast, secure, and reliable. 

Connection to control traffic
Secures services through authentication
Enforces policies across the fleet
Observes traffic flow
Traces call flows and dependencies. 

Features:
Load balances traffic for different protocols. 
TSL-encrypted communications between services in a cluster combined with authen and authorization. 
Granular configuration of traffic flow (routing rules) and control
Policies and API support, access controls, rate limits and quotas. 
Automatic monitoring, logging and tracking traffic.

Istio and kubernetes:
- Extensible 
- Handles diverse deployment needs. 
- Enables the addition of applications of a cluster to the mesh. 
- The extension of the mesh to additional clusters
- Connections to virtual machines or other endpoints running outside of kubernetes. 

How it works: 
All network traffic is intercepted by a proxy called envoy used by the service mesh. 
- Control plane:
  Gives Discovery configuration certificates to services
  Receives metrics
- Data plane

Microservices:
- A single apps has many loosly coupled services. 
- Well defined APIs for communication
- Benefits include easy updates to code, allowing differente technology stacks for differente components and scaling components independently
- Challenges:
  - Traffic encryption, canary deplkoyments and A/B testing to cascading failures (retries, circuit breaking
  - Retries and circuit breaking. 
- Defends from man in the middle attacks.
