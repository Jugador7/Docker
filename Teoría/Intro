Docker process:
- Apps: go into container

Written in Go. 

Uses Linux kernel's features to deliver functionality
Uses the namespaces technology to provide an isolated workspace: Container
Creates a set of namespaces for every container and each aspect runs in a separate namespace with access limited to that namespace. 

Additional docker technologies: Docker Cli, compose and prometheus. 
Supports Agile and DevOps. 

Easy versioning, collaboration, modularity and scaling.
