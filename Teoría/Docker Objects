Objects:
1. Dockerfile: Text file that contains instructions needed to create an image
Created using any editor from the console or terminal 
Instructions:
- FROM: Defines base image
- RUN:Executes arbitrary commands
- CMD: Defines default command for container execution

2. Dockerimage
Read-only template with instructions for creating Docker container.
Built using instructions in a Dockerfile; a new read-only image layer is created for each instruction.
A writeable (read-write) layer is added when an image is run as a container
Layers can be shared between images, wich saves disk space and network bandwith
Container image naming:
hostname(identifies image registry)/repository(group of container images):tag(especific version or variant)
e.g. docker.io/ubuntu:18.04

3. Containers
Runnable instance of an image
Can be created, stopped, started or deleted using the Docker API or CLI
Can connect to multiple networks, attach storage or create a new image based on its current state. 
Isolated from other containers and its host machine. 

4. Networks, Storage y Plugins
Networks are used for the isolated container communication
Storage: Docker uses volumens and bind mounts to persist data even after a container stops. 
Plugins and Addons: Storage plugins provide the ability to connect to external storage platforms.
